Presented at the Center for Health and Society at the University of Copenhagen, 29th of February and 1st of March, 2016

Contents:
* ConceptualFoundations.pdf: Slides for 'Agent Based Models: Conceptual Foundations', covering the concepts behind ABMs, why they are distinct from other types of models, and when they should be used.

* InPractice.pdf: Slides for 'Agent Based Models in Public Health Practice', a look at several agent-based models used in public health research, including a deep dive into Ebola modeling work

* NetLogo.pdf: Slides for the beginning of the hands-on modeling workshop with NetLogo, containing code for the "Logo Tron" model

* tron.nlogo: A basic NetLogo file where two types of agents compete to claim colored patches. Covers agent movement, breeds, and environmental interaction

* pollution.nlogo: An environmental epidemiology example where factories contaminate the environment, resulting in exposure to a randomly moving population, and eventually disease outcomes. Basic implementation of diffusion and visualization, beginnings of an implementation of pollution cleanup processes (like water purification)
